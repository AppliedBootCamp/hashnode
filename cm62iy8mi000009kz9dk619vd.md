Network visualization is a cornerstone of data science and knowledge representation, offering an intuitive way to analyze relationships and patterns in complex datasets. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), their integration into network analysis workflows has introduced novel capabilities, including enhanced contextual understanding and semantic enrichment. This article explores network visualization using Neo4j and Gephi, two popular tools in the domain, and examines how LLMs influence this process.
